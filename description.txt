ATTENTION: There is a conflict between Enigma and Pinkysmod that causes worlds to not load. If you are experiencing an error that says something along the lines of "Backup failed to load", it is most likely because you have pinkysmod on. We have no idea what could be causing it, and pinkysmod seems to conflict with other mods as well, so we're fairly sure it's either on pinky's side or a bug with tModLoader, so there's not much we can do. Sorry for the inconvenience!
